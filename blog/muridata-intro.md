**MuriData is a decentralized retrievable database designed to be the backbone of data for decentralized applications.**

Using both zero-knowledge proof and optimism, it strikes a perfect balance between scalability and security. 
Database operations and queries are easy to operate and verify, bringing the incredible ability to query data with high performance to dapps.

It is the foundation of future projects for Shugetsu Soft.

### Goal

MuriData will become the decentralized indexable database.
It utilizes blockchain to power its incentivization system and makes high-performance querying comes true through refined design.
Specifically, MuriData will offer a market to exchange data indexing and querying ability. Anyone who join this network can become the provider or client. Both parties are restricted by mathematical algorithms and game theory to reduce the possibility of cheating and malicious behavior. Also, any developer who wishs to provide searching ability can choose to join and access the MuriData network.

### Why

#### Decentralized Data Indexing System is hard to design

Traditional databases often need to be deployed at private-owned data centers where every node is under centralized control without Byzantine nodes. However, in a decentralized system, nodes are selfish and sometimes malicious. To build trust in the dark forest, we need a new design that allows nodes to correctly index data and handle queries.

Besides, centralized databases can offer high performance enabling many now-operating internet software. Achieving higher performance in a decentralized system requires some tricks to be adopted (Zero-knowledge proof, Optimism), which is a huge challenge.

#### MuriData is needed

Dapps are now flourishing on various blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Cosmos, and Polkadot. These apps must be able to query and store user data efficiently. Without MuriData, there will be no more complex and practical system.

### How

**WARN: This project is still in the theoretical stage. There is no evidence to prove its practicality now.**
The white paper is in progress. Please stay tuned.
There is no implementation.

**This project is now being developed by [Rorical](https://github.com/Rorical).**
